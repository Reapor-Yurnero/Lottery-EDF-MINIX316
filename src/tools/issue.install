Welcome to MINIX 3.1.6.

The system is now running and many commands work normally.  To use MINIX
in a serious way, you need to install it to your hard disk, which you
can do by typing 'setup' while logged in as root.  Then just follow the
on-screen directions.

After setup is complete, type 'shutdown' and when the boot monitor
starts, boot your new system by following the instructions at the end of
setup.  Keep the CD-ROM in the drive, login as root and type 'packman'
to begin installing the many software packages available.  After you
have installed the packages, type 'xdm' to start X Windows if you have
installed it.
